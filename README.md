## Feedback App (React)

This React project is a feedback type SPA where users can rate and comment on a product or service. Posts can be deleted or editted. <br/>
**Please Note**: This project is now active with async get, put, post and delete functionalities to work with a back-end solution. Created and tested with the 'json-server' NPM package.
The project was initially setup with a local data file (data.js) to work as a non-persistent front-end app. The original code for this still lives within the app (commented out).
